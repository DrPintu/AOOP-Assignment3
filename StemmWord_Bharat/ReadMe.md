Assignment:
Given a text paragraph or any paragraph taken by text file reading in Java, you have to find inflected words and print their root forms. You need to create one text area for showing (or entering) the paragraph. When you click on a certain button, another text area will show the inflected words along with their roots. You are not allowed to use any given libraries for this task. Simply take the stemmer project from certain group of students (the one some of you developed last semester) and modify that by adding new rules or techniques.

As an example, consider the following text.

He was flying 10000 feet above. All passengers including him were enjoying the flight.....

Output may look like follows

flying -- > fly
Passengers --> Passenger
... and so on.


Instruction for running the program:-

1. Compile Assignment2.java file.
2. Now run this file and you will see GUI interface.

5. Now click on the "Run for stemming' button to find and show you the stem words in your given text.

Follow these steps and you will see your required result.

Assignment2.java is the main class which contains main method to run the java file. Stemming.java is the helper file which contains Stemming class for our help as this contins main code for stemming check and finding its root word.
